# Gyoza
ðŸ¥Ÿ **Gyoza** is a set of **dotnet standard** librairies which help you to develop *feature oriented services*! **Gyoza** librairies can be used to build *Microservices* or setup *Function as a Service (FaaS) architecture*.

> ðŸš§ **Gyoza** is under development and can't be considered as stable yet. Some infrastructure libraries are currently used by some french Microsoft field engineers on internal samples/tools. Base code is inspired by another set of librairies design by [Sylvain Pontoreau](https://github.com/Vtek) and [Julien Pavon](https://github.com/JulienPavon) early in 2016.
